  <P>I am a student at Drexel University majoring in User Experience and Interaction Design. Through the purpose of user experience, we bridge the gap between technology and art. I strive to design experiences that connect and inspire users everywhere. Digital design is always expanding and I want to contribute to making it more accessible, more enjoyable and easier for everyone to use. Together, let’s explore the potential in UXID to create greater things!</P>
  <p>Beyond the professional world, I am a Vietnamese-American born and raised in Philadelphia. I love to explore all kinds of art. Whether that be music, painting, photography, etc… I have a passionate appreciation for art and it provides an escape for me.</p>
  <p>I am excited to continue my academic journey at Drexel and grow not only as a person but also as a UX designer!</p>
