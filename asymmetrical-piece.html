				<p><strong>Asymmetrical Piece</strong>: For this project, the main objective was to play around with negative and positive space and then add in another element, the space when B&amp;W were mixed. I looked at a variety of pictures and magazines to then find intricate outlines within the spaces to create new biomorphic and abstract shapes.
					With all my new shapes, I assembled them into a composition that I found interesting enough. After that, I carefully chose what I wanted to be black, white or gray. The project required a large amount of precision since all of the lines were free-handed with paint. In the end, I was able to create an asymmetrical piece that allowed me to introduce myself to mixing positive and negative spaces.</p>
