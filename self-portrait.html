				<p><strong>Pop Art Self Portrait</strong>: For this exercise, it was inspired by pop art. The main objective was to experiment with colors and include the elements that we see from famous artists such as Andy Warhol. I experimented with patterns and the placements of where I would want them. I also paid attention to shadows and highlights and made sure to include them in this piece.</p>
