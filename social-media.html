				<p><strong>Social Media Post</strong>: For this small project, the objective was to create a social media poster that would allow an audience to get to know you better but to also keep it short. I included small fun facts so that it would feel more personal and then when posted, it would be followed by a description as well. I picked purple and pink as my main colors to go for a playful aura for this social media post. In the end, it was a fun and quick project to work on to show more of my design style and personality.</p>
